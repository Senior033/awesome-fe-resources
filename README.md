- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) - Though developed in the year 2016, this JavaScript framework has already made its way into the market and has proven its worth by offering various features. Its dual integration mode is one of the most attractive features for the creation of high-end SPA or Single Page Application. It is a much reliable platform for developing cross-platform.
- [Angular](https://angular.io) - One of the most powerful, efficient, and open-source JavaScript frameworks is Angular.
